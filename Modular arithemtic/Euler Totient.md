Euler's totient function deonted as $\phi{(n)}$, count the positive intehers up to a given integer $n$ that are relatively prime to $n$.

The function is a multiplicative function, meaning that ig two numbers $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime then:
$$\phi{(mn)} = \phi{(m)}\phi{(n)}$$
If $m$ and $n$ are different prime numbers we have:
$$\phi{(mn)} = \phi{(m)}\phi{(n)}=(m-1)(n-1)$$
